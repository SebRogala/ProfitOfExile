		'Price and listings are steady. Safe to farm — predictable returns. Triggered: price velocity < \u00b12c/h, listing velocity < \u00b13/h',
	UNCERTAIN:
		'Directional prediction accuracy is below 50% (coin flip) — showing raw market data instead. Price velocity and listing trends are available for your own assessment.',
	HERD: "Both price AND listings are rising. Multiple farmers flooding the market. Sell now if you have stock. Don't start farming \u2014 you're late. Triggered: price velocity > 5, listing velocity > 10",
	DUMPING:
		'Price dropping while listings rise. Sellers undercutting each other. Avoid \u2014 will keep falling. Triggered: price velocity < -5, listing velocity > 5',
	RECOVERY:
		'Price and listings both dropping. Supply drying up \u2014 potential comeback. Watch for COMEBACK signal. Triggered: price velocity < -5, listing velocity < -5',

		'No farming opportunity detected. Base gems available but no special conditions.',

		'Base gems starting to drain. Window score is moderate. Prepare to act soon. Triggered: window score \u2265 50, base velocity < 0',

		"Herd arriving \u2014 other farmers' transfigured gems hitting the market. Sell immediately if you have stock. Triggered: trans listing velocity > 3",

export const ADVANCED_TOOLTIPS: Record<string, string> = {
	COMEBACK:
		"Was in the top gems previously, crashed, now showing recovery. Lower herd risk since it's no longer on poe.ninja's front page. Good for experienced farmers. Triggered: hist position < 30%, price rising, listings dropping",
	POTENTIAL:
		'Rising ROI that hasn\'t been widely noticed yet. Low competition, moderate price, rising trend. Best opportunity for experienced players who want low-herd-risk plays. Triggered: price 30-200c, < 40 listings, price rising, below historical midpoint',
	PRICE_MANIPULATION:
		'Suspicious pricing. Very few listings at high price with no movement. Likely someone trying to set a fake price floor. Avoid. Triggered: \u2264 3 listings, price > 200c, no velocity, high CV',
	BREAKOUT:
		'Price breaking above historical range with rising listings. Genuine demand increase, not manipulation. Strong buy/farm signal. Triggered: price > 90th percentile, listings rising, positive velocity',

	CV: "Coefficient of Variation \u2014 how predictable the price is. Lower = more stable. Under 25% is safe, 25-50% is moderate, over 100% is a trap. Calculated from price standard deviation over 7 days.",
